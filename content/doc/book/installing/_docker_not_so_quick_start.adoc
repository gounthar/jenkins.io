[[using-the-wizard-with-docker-compose]]
== Using the wizard.

The first method we proposed (<<quickstart-tutorials-repository>>) is the easiest way to get Jenkins up and running.
However, you may want to have a better feel of what's happening under the hood. +
This is where the second method comes in. +
You can still use the same link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials.git[quickstart-tutorials repository] as in the first step. +
If you have already launched the Jenkins instance previously, you can stop it by running the command `docker compose down -v --remove-orphans`. +
Once it's done, you can proceed with the second method.

[source,bash]
----
docker compose --profile wizard up
----
This time, we're not using the `default` profile, but the `wizard` profile.
This profile will guide you through the setup of Jenkins.
We're not using the `-d` or `--detach` option, so you can see the output of the containers, and get a better understanding of what's happening.
After a while, you should see something like this displaying in the console:
[source,bash]
----

Copy the generated password, and access the Jenkins controller at http://localhost:8080 .

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/unlock-jenkins.png[alt="Copying initial admin password",width=860] +
Paste the password in the *Administrator password* field, and click on the *Continue* button.

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/choose-plugins-installation.png[alt="Choosing plugins",width=860] +
Two options are available: *Install suggested plugins* and *Select plugins to install*. +
We'll choose the *Install suggested plugins* option for this tutorial, but you could choose the other option if you already know which plugins you will need.

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/plugins-installation.png[alt="Plugins installing",width=860] +
The default set of plugins will then be installed. +
This process may take a few minutes.
You will then be presented with the *Create First Admin User* page.

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/create-first-admin-user.png[alt="Creating first admin user",width=860] +
You can create the first admin user by filling in the required fields.
Once you've filled in the fields, click on the *Save and Continue* button.
You will then be redirected to the *Instance Configuration* page.

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/instance-configuration.png[alt="Instance configuration",width=860] +
That's the place where you'll configure the Jenkins controller's URL.
By default, it is set to `http://localhost:8080`. +
You can keep it as is.
Click on the *Save and Finish* button.

Depending on the set of plugins installed, you may be redirected to the Jenkins dashboard or to this page, stating that Jenkins has to be restarted.

1. Obtain the latest Jenkins instance, customized for this tutorial, by cloning the link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials.git[quickstart-tutorials repository].
2. After cloning, navigate to the `quickstart-tutorials` directory, and execute the command `docker compose --profile default up -d` to run the example.
3. Once the containers are running successfully (you can verify this with `docker compose ps`), the controller can be accessed at http://localhost:8080.

If you are unable to install `docker compose` on your machine for any reason, you can still run the example in the cloud for free thanks to link:https://www.gitpod.io/[GitPod]. GitPod link:https://www.gitpod.io/pricing[is free] for 50 hours per month.
You need to link it to your GitHub account so you can run the example in the cloud.
Click on link:https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials[that link] to open a new browser tab with a GitPod workspace where you'll be able to start the Jenkins instance, and run the rest of this guide.

Now, log in via your browser using the `admin` username and `admin` password on link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080].

[[connecting-an-agent-with-docker-compose]]
== Connecting an agent

Now that you have your Jenkins controller up and running, you can connect an agent to it.
In this tutorial, we'll use an link:/doc/pipeline/steps/ssh-agent/#ssh-agent-plugin[SSH agent] that will be running in a Docker container.
To do so, you need to create a new agent in Jenkins and configure it to connect to the agent container.
But first of all, we need to install the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ssh-agent-plugin[SSH agent plugin] and create the credentials.

=== Installing the SSH agent plugin

Once connected to the dashboard, click on *Manage Jenkins* in the left-hand menu.
Then, click on *Plugins*.
Click on the *Available Plugins* menu, and then in the search box enter `SSH agent`.

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/install-ssh-agent-plugin.png[alt="Installing the SSH agent plugin",width=860] +
Click in the checkbox under *"Install* and click on the *Install* blue button on the right.

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/docker/installing-ssh-agent-plugin.png[alt="Installing the SSH agent plugin",width=860] +
You can then click on the checkbox just next to *Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running*.

=== Creating the credentials

[[accessing-the-jenkins-docker-containers]]
== Accessing the Docker containers

If you'd like to access the Docker container running your Jenkins controller through a terminal or command prompt using the link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/exec/[`docker compose exec`] command, include the name of the service within the command to get something like:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker compose exec jenkins_controller bash
jenkins@be6994815148:/$ # We are now in the container running Jenkins
----

This will access the Docker container named "jenkins_controller."
As with standard access to a machine, you can exit the container by typing `exit` or pressing +++<kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>+++.

To access the Docker container running your Jenkins agent, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker compose exec default_agent bash
jenkins@be6994815148:/$ # We are now in the container running the Jenkins agent
----

To leave the container, type `exit` or press +++<kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>+++.

[[accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs]]
== Accessing the Docker logs

Should you need to access the services logs, you can do so by running the following command:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose logs -f
----

This command will display the logs of all services running in the dockerized Jenkins instance.
You will see the logs of the Jenkins controller, Jenkins agent, and the side-kick service.
If you would like to see the logs of a specific service, you can do so by specifying the service name as follows:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose logs -f <service-name>
----

With `<service-name>` being:

- `jenkins_controller` for the Jenkins controller
- `default_agent` for the Jenkins agent

== Accessing the Jenkins home directory

You can access the Jenkins home directory, to check the details of a Jenkins build in the `jobs` subdirectory, for example.
To access the Jenkins home directory, use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose exec jenkins_controller bash
----

You will then be in the Jenkins controller container.
To access the Jenkins home directory, use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
jenkins@be6994815148:/$ cd /var/jenkins_home/jobs
jenkins@be6994815148:/var/jenkins_home/jobs$ ls -la
----

This will list all the jobs in the Jenkins home directory.

Should you want to copy the jobs subdirectory from the Jenkins home directory to your local machine, you can use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose cp jenkins_controller:/var/jenkins_home/jobs <local-path>
----

With `<local-path>` being the path on your local machine where you want to copy the jobs subdirectory.
