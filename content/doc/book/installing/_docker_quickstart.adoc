=== Linux containers on Windows

The Jenkins project provides both Linux and link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/tags?page=1&name=windows[Windows container images].
However, this tutorial specifically focuses on the Linux container images.
Therefore, ensure that your Docker for Windows installation is configured to run Linux Containers rather than link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=dockerce[Windows Containers].
You can refer to the Docker documentation for instructions on how to link:https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/[use Linux containers].

=== Start your Jenkins controller/agent combo

1. Obtain the latest Jenkins instance, customized for this tutorial, by cloning the link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials.git[quickstart-tutorials repository] or by downloading the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials/main/docker-compose.yaml[`docker-compose.yaml`] file.
2. After cloning, navigate to the `quickstart-tutorials` directory, and execute the command `docker compose --profile default up -d` to run the example.
This time, we're not using the `wizard` profile, but the `default` profile.
3. Once the containers are running successfully (you can verify this with `docker compose ps`), the controller can be accessed at http://localhost:8080.

If you are unable to install `docker compose` on your machine for any reason, you can still run the example in the cloud for free thanks to link:https://www.gitpod.io/[GitPod]. GitPod link:https://www.gitpod.io/pricing[is free] for 50 hours per month.
You need to link it to your GitHub account so you can run the example in the cloud.
Click on link:https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials[that link] to open a new browser tab with a GitPod workspace where you'll be able to start the Jenkins instance, and run the rest of this guide.

Now, log in via your browser using the `admin` username and `admin` password on link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080].

== Accessing the Docker containers

If you'd like to access the Docker container running your Jenkins controller through a terminal or command prompt using the link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/exec/[`docker compose exec`] command, include the name of the service within the command to get something like:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker compose exec jenkins_controller bash
jenkins@be6994815148:/$ # We are now in the container running Jenkins
----

This will access the Docker container named "jenkins_controller."
As with standard access to a machine, you can exit the container by typing `exit` or pressing +++<kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>+++.

To access the Docker container running your Jenkins agent, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker compose exec default_agent bash
jenkins@be6994815148:/$ # We are now in the container running the Jenkins agent
----

To leave the container, type `exit` or press +++<kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>+++.

[[accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs]]
== Accessing the Docker logs

Should you need to access the services logs, you can do so by running the following command:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose logs -f
----

This command will display the logs of all services running in the dockerized Jenkins instance.
You will see the logs of the Jenkins controller, Jenkins agent, and the side-kick service.
If you would like to see the logs of a specific service, you can do so by specifying the service name as follows:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose logs -f <service-name>
----

With `<service-name>` being:

- `jenkins_controller` for the Jenkins controller
- `default_agent` for the Jenkins agent

== Accessing the Jenkins home directory

You can access the Jenkins home directory, to check the details of a Jenkins build in the `jobs` subdirectory, for example.
To access the Jenkins home directory, use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose exec jenkins_controller bash
----

You will then be in the Jenkins controller container.
To access the Jenkins home directory, use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
jenkins@be6994815148:/$ cd /var/jenkins_home/jobs
jenkins@be6994815148:/var/jenkins_home/jobs$ ls -la
----

This will list all the jobs in the Jenkins home directory.

Should you want to copy the jobs subdirectory from the Jenkins home directory to your local machine, you can use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose cp jenkins_controller:/var/jenkins_home/jobs <local-path>
----

With `<local-path>` being the path on your local machine where you want to copy the jobs subdirectory.
