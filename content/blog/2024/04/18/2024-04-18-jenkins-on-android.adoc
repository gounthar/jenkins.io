I know it's been over a year since the first article of this series, but hey, life happens!
I've been juggling quite a few things that are more important for the Jenkins project.
Let's face it, nobody's losing sleep over running Jenkins on Android.
But hey, sometimes you just gotta indulge in a bit of tech whimsy, am I right?

So, here we are, diving back into this almost frivolous experiment to see just how far we can push the Jenkins-Android interaction.
There are essentially two ways to stretch the boundaries with Jenkins and Android:

. Building Android apps with Jenkins
. Running Jenkins on an Android device

Now, the first option has already had its moment in the spotlight in another series of articles, so we're turning our attention to the latter.
Why, you might ask?
Well, because why not? Because we're tech enthusiasts, and if there's a crazy idea floating around, we're going to give it a shot!

== Setting up Jenkins Controller on Android

In the previous article, we had already layed the groundwork for running a Jenkins agent on Android.
We had installed Termux, OpenSSH, and Java on the Android device, and checked that the agent could be reached from an adult-sized Jenkins controller.
We even managed to get it to run a FreeStyle pipeline that outputed the result of the `uname -a` command.
Quite an achievement, heh?
For this experiment, we're still using my old Redmi Note 7, which is running Android 10.
Keep in mind this device was put aside because it was too slow for my daily use, so it's not the best hardware to run Jenkins on.
I also know I could get Linux to run on it instead of Android, but that would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Let's try to launch a Jenkins controller on this device, shall we?

I have already made attempts on memory-constrained devices, and I know that a Jenkins controller can work with 1GB of RAM.
I don't know how much memory the Android system will give to termux, and how much termux will give to the JVM, but let's give it a shot!
When logged in through ssh from my PC, I get:
[source,bash]
----
~ $ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3.6Gi       2.1Gi        80Mi       3.0Mi       1.5Gi       1.3Gi
Swap:          2.2Gi       1.6Gi       623Mi
----

It looks like the device has 3.6GB of RAM, which should be enough to run a Jenkins controller.
Let's run a Jenkins controller thanks to the `jenkins.war` file, which is the easiest way to run Jenkins.
First thing first, let's download the `jenkins.war` file.
The latest LTS version of Jenkins can be found at https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war.
At the time of the writing, the latest LTS version referenced by the link:/download/#downloading-jenkins[official documentation] is `2.440.3`.
But... We have to install `curl` first.

[source,bash]
----
pkg install curl
----

Now we can download the `jenkins.war` file.
[source,bash]
----
curl -L -O https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
----

Now that we have the `jenkins.war` file, we can run it.
[source,bash]
----
java -jar jenkins.war
----

The first lines look like the ones we are used to:

[source,bash]
----
~ $ java -jar jenkins.war

The web page is also looking familiar, except for the path where the password is stored:

In the logs, we can see Jenkins complaining about the lack of a `/tmp` dir:

[source,bash]
----
/tmp does not exist.

Apart from that, the install goes smoothly, and the default plugins get installed.

image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/plugins-install.png[standard plugins install,860]

The installation goes to its end, and we get as always a security warning about the use of the built-in node.

This has nothing to do with the fact we're using termux, and we'll remediate this later.

This is quite a milestone, isn't it? We proved we can launch a Jenkins controller thanks to termux on an Android device.
But we're not done yet, we have to make sure this Jenkins controller can be launched as a service, and later on transform it so it can be started at boot time.

=== Launching the controller via Java command.
=== Transforming it into a service for seamless operation.
=== Ensuring availability from boot for uninterrupted service.
== Adding Jenkins Agent on Android
=== Establishing SSH connection for agent integration.
=== Configuring the agent to communicate with the controller.
== Creating a Pipeline from GitHub Repo
=== Setting up a pipeline to automate tasks.
=== Linking the pipeline to a GitHub repository for version control.
== Conclusion
=== Reflecting on the process and achievements.
=== Teasing a funny opening for the next adventure.
=== Bonus: Funny Opening
